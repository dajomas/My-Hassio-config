      #   value_template: '{{as_timestamp(states.automation.zijgevel_openen.attributes.last_triggered) | int <= as_timestamp(states.automation.zijgevel_sluiten.attributes.last_triggered) | int }}' # this automation can only be triggered if timestamp of last_triggered time is OLDER than the timestamp of last_triggered time of the "screen down" automation. This condition prevents that the automation is triggered again if sunscreen is already up. Better would be to have a real sensor checking if sunscreen is up or down but currently I don't have a sensor in place. The | int is used to catch the fact that on start up both triggers report 'none' and hence this condition would never become true. The int makes it such that value = 0 for both and hence trigger can be executed.
